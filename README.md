## Fend Arcade ML
===============================

## What is this? 
The main game functionality was written by [Sandra Israel-Ovirih](https://github.com/sandraisrael)

>  Forked from https://github.com/sandraisrael/fend-arcade-game/

## Try it out
[Arcade Game](https://ashinzekene.github.io/fend-arcade-ML/)

## Instructions
* Click on the direction buttons and then speak your custom commands
* After this, then train the model to recognise the commands
* After that, you can then start the game
* Use **speech commands** to move the player: up, down, left, right. 
* Ensure your player doesn't collide with the bugs. You loose a life and 50pts on any collison.
* You can export and import your trained voices with the "Download audio examples" and "Upload Audio Sample" button

### Pretrained model

The simple pretrained model demo is available [here](https://github.com/ashinzekene/fend-arcade-ML/tree/pretrained-model). You'd have to run that locally
